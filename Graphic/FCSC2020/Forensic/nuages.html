            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                First of all, I'm not going to detail all the avenues I've explored to solve this challenge. I'm only going to show the right steps to solving it. <br>
                If you want the complete research process, contact me via my Twitter. <br><br>
                Given the difficulty of the challenge, you shouldn't try to flag in a too "random" way, so I'm thinking about a way that could certify me the location of the password, as well as the username in the memory.<br>
                So I decide to put down a sheet of paper, to see the elements I've gathered, and that could help me to solve this challenge.<br>
                So I come to the conclusion that, to be sure of the location of the password in the memory, I must have a second dump that faithfully reproduces the identification in the dump.<br>
                So we're going to make our own dump! Remember at the beginning, with my research for the other challenges, I had observed two things:<br>
                    - There is a nginx server<br>
                    - Authentication is basic auth on /panel<br>
                So we're going to set this up in the virtual machine:<br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/nuages.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>
            </div>
            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                We add this line in the nginx configuration. I chose as username and password very identifiable words, to recognize them directly in the dump :<br>
                    - Username: JESUISUNUSERNAME<br>
                    - Password: C3C1ESTUNPASSWORD<br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/nuages2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>
            </div>
            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                Perfect, we have faithfully reproduced the authentication used in the dump!<br>
                We will now do a memory dump, thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME">LiMe</a>. I won't describe here how to do it, it's very well explained on the github that hosts the project.<br><br>
                Be careful, I didn't specify it, but you have to use the chromium browser, as in the challenge dump, for the comparison of the two to be efficient.<br>
                Once I've recovered my second dump, there are several hypotheses:<br>
                    - "The difference" between the password and the username is the same, no matter how chromium is used.<br>
                    -  Dump all chromium processes from my own dump, identify where the username and password are, and do the same in the challenge dump.<br>
                Here's a problem: I have two potential usernames, and I may be missing some.<br><br>
                So I decide to focus on the username in the chall's dump, to be 100% sure and refine my next searches on the password.<br>
                I dump all the chromium processes in my dump, and I observe that my username is not present in it, which seems very strange to me, given the very recognizable value it has. <br>
                So I check on the internet, and, on a stack overflow forum, a person advises to look at the strings of the file in UTF-16, and not in UTF-8, which results in the -el option of the strings command.<br>
                So I do this on my dump, and miraculously, my username and password appear!<br>
                So I assume that it must be the same on the challenge dump. So I will string the challenge dump with this option, to see if other username appear:<br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/nuages3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>
            </div>
            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                (Aside)<br>
                Throughout my research, I kept in mind that the flag was case sensitive, so I had a big doubt that Admin3 was the username. (but that was just a guess).<br>
                (End of the aside)<br><br>
                A very interesting username comes up: Admin3Kz7. So I decide to add it to my list of potential username, which becomes :<br>
                    - Admin3<br>
                    - Admin3Kz7<br>
                Now, to check 100% of the username, I will dump the chromium processes of the challenge one by one, and check if I find "Admin3" or "Admin3Kz7" in it.<br>
                After one hour, I filtered them all, by doing the command : strings -el * | grep -i "Admin3" on it, and only one came back with a result :<br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/nuages4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>
            </div>
            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                When you extract everything related to it with the command:<br>
                volatility --profile=Linuxdebian-5-4-0-4-amd64x64 -f dmp.mem linux_dump_map -p 119187 --dump-dir dump/<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                It can be seen that this process contains : Admin3Kz7.<br>
                So I am now 100% sure that the username is Admin3Kz7, and that the password is in the dump of process 119187.<br>
                Indeed, if I compare with my own dump, the username and the password are in the same dump of the chromium process, we can easily reach the conclusion I drew above.<br>
                Moreover, in my dump, I noticed that the username and the password were "next to each other", I know that this notion is very abstract in forensic, but it was my last lead. <br>
                In my dump, we can see that the username and the password are 7 strings apart:<br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/nuages5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>
            </div>
            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                I therefore deduce that in the challenge dump, and more particularly in the dump of the chromium process, it must be almost identical:<br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/nuages6.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>
            </div>
            <p class="lead" style="color: white;">
                Here, the only interesting string that strongly resembles a password is: "5sdtYh68".<br>
                I also kept in mind that the flag was case sensitive, so I came to the conclusion that the credentials used for the connection were right in front of me.<br>
                Indeed, we have a pretty self-explanatory username, and a string that looks like a password. <br>
                Moreover, the connection between the two dumps is quite strong, and doesn't leave too much room for randomness, except for the location of the string, but randomness was not very important.<br>
                So I decide to try this, and it's correct! The password was right: 5sdtYh68!<br>
                So we have our flag:<br>
                FCSC{Admin3Kz7:5sdtYh68} !
